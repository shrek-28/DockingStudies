# Antimicrobial Resistance 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widely recognized as one of the most pressing global public health challenges of the 21st century. 
It undermines the effectiveness of treatments and preventive measures against a growing spectrum of infections caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, 
and fungi that have become resistant to the drugs traditionally used to combat them. ([1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4768623/)).

Antimicrobial agents—including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, disinfectants, and food preservatives—are designed to either inhibit microbial growth or kill
the microorganisms. However, AMR is an inevitable consequence of evolutionary adaptation, arising as organisms acquire genetic mutations that enable them 
to withstand the selective pressure imposed by these agents.

Bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics through three primary mechanisms: intrinsic, acquired, and adaptive resistance.
* **Intrinsic resistance** refers to a bacterium’s natural, inherent ability to resist certain classes of antibiotics
due to specific chromosomal genes. This form of resistance exists without requiring genetic mutation
or the acquisition of new genes.
* **Acquired resistance** develops when a previously susceptible bacterium becomes resistant due to muta-
tions in its chromosomal DNA or through the acquisition of external genetic material via horizontal
gene transfer (HGT). The major modes of HGT include transformation, transposition, and conjugation.
* **Adaptive resistance** is a temporary or sometimes permanent resistance phenotype that emerges in
response to environmental stressors. Its stability depends on the nature and duration of the selective
pressure.

The spread and acquisition of AMR predominantly occur through human-to-human transmission, both
in healthcare settings and within the broader community. The risk is further exacerbated by environmen-
tal hotspots, including urban wastewater and sewage sludge, as well as agricultural sources such as pig
slurry, cow manure, and poultry-derived fertilizers, all of which serve as reservoirs and vectors for resistant
microorganisms.

Addressing AMR effectively demands a unified, global response. This includes the active collaboration
of international and national governments, public health authorities, scientific researchers, pharmaceutical
industries, hospital systems, agricultural stakeholders, and the general public. With strong political will and
coordinated action, this multifaceted alliance can slow the progression of AMR and alleviate the associated
health and economic burdens on societies worldwide
