# Computational Identification and Evaluation of Potential QaCA Inhibitors in ***Staphylococcus aureus*** Using Structure-Based Drug Discovery Techniques

## ðŸ¦  Targeting Antimicrobial Resistance in ESKAPE Pathogens
This project presents a complete structure-based drug discovery (SBDD) workflow for the computational identification and evaluation of potential small molecule inhibitors against the QaCA protein of Staphylococcus aureus, one of the high-priority ESKAPE pathogens associated with hospital-acquired infections and rising antimicrobial resistance.
Leveraging cheminformatics, molecular docking, and ADMET profiling tools, this project integrates molecular similarity, ligand preparation, protein-ligand interaction modeling, and early-stage drug-likeness evaluation â€” forming a comprehensive in silico framework from target selection to toxicity prediction.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives
* To computationally identify promising **QaCA inhibitors** in _S. aureus_ through **ligand similarity searches**.
* To conduct **structure-based virtual screening** using molecular docking with a well-prepared target binding site.
* To perform **drug-likeness and ADME-toxicity** evaluations using integrated cheminformatics pipelines.
* To provide a modular, reproducible, and extensible workflow for antimicrobial inhibitor discovery.
