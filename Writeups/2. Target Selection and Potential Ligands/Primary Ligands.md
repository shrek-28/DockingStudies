### 1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxamide

1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxamide is a synthetic compound of the 1,8-naphthyridine class that has been demonstrated to inhibit efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus, including QacA. Studies show that these compounds, when combined with antibiotics, significantly reduce the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ethidium bromide and β-lactam antibiotics in QacA-expressing strains, indicating effective inhibition of pump and restoration of antibiotic susceptibility.

### Carnosic Acid 
Carnosic acid is a phenolic diterpene derived from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) that has been shown to act as an efflux pump inhibitor in S. aureus. Experimental evidence demonstrates that carnosic acid can dissipate membrane potential and inhibit the activity of efflux pumps, including QacA, thereby enhancing the intracellular accumulation of antimicrobial agents and reducing bacterial resistance.

### Carnosol 
Carnosol, another phenolic diterpene from rosemary, has been evaluated for its anti-efflux pump activity in multidrug-resistant S. aureus. In laboratory studies, carnosol significantly suppressed efflux pump activity in extensively drug-resistant S. aureus strains, as evidenced by reduced efflux in flow cytometry assays and potentiation of gentamicin activity, supporting its role as a QacA inhibitor.
