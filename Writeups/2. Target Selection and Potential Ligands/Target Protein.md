# Target Protein: QacA - Structure and Functions

## QacA Protein Structure 
* QacA is a membrane-bound multidrug efflux protein found in Staphylococcus aureus.
* It belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters and consists of 14 transmembrane helices arranged in two helical bundles, with a unique extracellular α-helical hairpin loop (EL7) between 
helices 13 and 14. 
* The protein is composed of 514 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 55 kDa.
* The EL7 loop plays an allosteric role, essential for efficient drug efflux; its removal or disruption impairs
transporter function.
* The overall structure supports a rocker-switch mechanism for substrate transport, typical of MFS
antiporters.

## Function
* QacA confers resistance to a broad range of cationic antimicrobial agents, including:
    * Quaternary ammonium compounds (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine)
    * Intercalating dyes (e.g., ethidium bromide, acriflavine)
    * Diamidines and biguanidines 
* It operates as a proton-coupled antiporter, using the proton motive force to export toxic compounds
out of the bacterial cell in exchange for protons.
* QacA can recognize and expel both monovalent and divalent cationic substrates; distinct binding sites
exist for these substrate types, with specific acidic residues (e.g., D323) being crucial for divalent cation
recognition.
* This efflux activity is a major contributor to multidrug resistance in S. aureus, allowing survival in the
presence of disinfectants and antiseptics.

The expression of qacA is regulated by the QacR protein, a TetR-family transcriptional repressor that binds to the qacA operator region and modulates gene expression in response to environmental signals.
