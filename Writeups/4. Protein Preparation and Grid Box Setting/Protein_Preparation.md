# Protein Preparation 

The goal of protein preparation is to generate protein models that accurately represent the bioactive conformations of the protein when ligands are bound. This ensures that computational studies, such as molecular docking or virtual screening, are based on realistic and biologically relevant structures, increasing the reliability of predictions.

The crystal CryoEM structure of QacA (D411N), an antibacterial efflux transporter from _Staphylococcus aureus_ was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using accession ID 6AH9. (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7Y58)

The structure 7Y58 was chosen as the target model for molecular docking research related to QacA because it represents a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of QacA (a major facilitator superfamily antibacterial efflux transporter) from Staphylococcus aureus in an outward-open conformation. This structure includes important features like the extracellular helical hairpin loop (EL7), which plays an allosteric and vital role in antibacterial efflux and is conserved among a subset of related transporters. The 7Y58 structure also includes a single mutation (D411N) that improves homogeneity while retaining efflux activity, making it highly reliable for studying substrate binding and transport mechanisms relevant to antimicrobial resistance.
